The _putchar function takes a character c as input and writes that character to the standard output (stdout) using the write() system call. It returns 1 upon successful writing and -1 in case of an error, with errno set to specify the type of error that occurred during the writing operation.

This function can be used as a building block for outputting characters, and it mimics the behavior of the standard putchar() function in C, which outputs a single character to the console.
